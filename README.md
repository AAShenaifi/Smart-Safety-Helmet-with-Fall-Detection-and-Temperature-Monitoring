# Smart-Safety-Helmet-with-Fall-Detection-and-Temperature-Monitoring
ESP32-based wearable with GPS tracking, temperature sensing, fall detection, and Telegram alert notifications |  Hardware design | Embedded firmware | Communication systems 

A safety helmet powered by ESP32, designed to protect workers in hazardous environments. The system features a DHT11 sensor to monitor body temperature, a GPS module for location tracking, and a tilt switch for fall detection. When a fall occurs or the temperature exceeds a critical threshold, an alert is sent to a supervisor via a Telegram bot, complete with real-time GPS coordinates. This project combines IoT, sensor technology, and real-time communication to enhance workplace safety and enable prompt emergency response
